// 2018.01.04
use Eigen::Map change the matrix to vector 

// 2018.01.05
finally get the cloth visualized, but the codes need to be optimized

// 2018.01.07
add the geometrit controller
should use glDrawElements instead of glDrawArrays?

use here the GL_POINTS to get only the vertexs

// 2018.01.09
only see the half???

// 2018.01.10
test points can be displayed correctly;
bunny.ply can be displayed correctly;

CMakeList can still not find the .ui in GUI folder, but in src folder

// 2018.01.14
compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors

// 2018.01.15
compute the stretch tensor U

// 2018.01.16
compute the deformation gradient F. here is T = [u1 u2][u1_ u2_]^-1

// 2018.01.21
first tried to use trimesh, but doesn't work
install libmesh correctly

// 2109.01.22
don't know how to get the neighbor, think maybe need "neighbor_ptr_range" https://libmesh.github.io/doxygen/classlibMesh_1_1NodeElem.html ,need a Elem class? what else?

write the function to normalize and to get color, but if i need to write this as .ply, I need change cast the type from double to int?

for outr new implement just change dim=2 tp dim=3 for calc_color

// 2019.01.23
problems:
<TriMesh>: can't read ply files
<LibMesh>: need c++14 feature? gcc 5+?

// 2019.01.24
add wirtecolor, write as 256 color
need map from one value to (256,256,256)?

// 2019.01.25
correct eigenvalue_normalize

// 2019.01.28
if use this 
            // F = R * U
            // ->
            // C = F^T * F = (R*U)^T * (R*U) = U^T * R^T * R * U
            // ->
            // C = U^T * U
and
H=USV 
both got really small eigenvalues compared to Rohmer et al.

// 2019.01.30
which library use for color map? there are many in internet

// 2019.01.31
summary:
1. USE kabisch algorithm on neighbor, and directly discomposition of H : Peoblem(negative eigenvalues -> negativ volumen see Smith et al.)
2. USR kabisch algorithm on neighbor, and calcaute U at first like traditional Conti, no negative eigenvalues
	maybe colth could have neg. eigval because it is not rigid body???

// 2019.02.01
use colormap from http://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/ 
	          https://gist.github.com/ialhashim/f52e1a4788e9feaf7d51
colormap -> need to be discussed. I divide by max again because some eigenval>1;

// 2019.02.01
colormap can be displayed correctly -> see Eigenval_loop_for_vertice 
	both kabisch algorthim got really small eigenvalues???
3. USR pseudoinverse followed by Rohmer et al at 3D.. Can;t use U? directly decomposistion on F -> negative eigenvalues.
furthture works, use pseudoinverse on neighbor? need to be discussed...
